Project Name: 'Zoom Over' Premiere

Description: The concept of our film was about how the pandemic has effected our relationships with friends and family by not allowing us to see each other more 
often. Thus, the movie itself depicts two friends trying to get back that connection by meeting over Zoom after a while. The film's motivation was inspired
by our own lives for the past two years and the importance of friendship and staying connected during these times. 
To communicate this idea, I wanted to focus on female friendship and (stereotypically) used light shades of pink, white and red throughout the website to convey this. The background photo was multiple hearts, again pushing the idea of love and friendship immediately to the user as they enter the website. The gradient color in the opening page allows the user to realize that the page moves downwards even before they notice the scroll button at the bottom. The floating text that appears
when the user first comes onto the page is a cute tagline for the film but also just a quote that may be memorable for the user.
After scrolling down, either with the mouse or clicking on the button at the bottom, the users are presented with the embedded video that displays the film itself. 
The full page also allows for the synopsis to show right under the film so the reader can quickly skim over the text while playing the video or even before/after
as it does not really impact how they understand the film.
The next section introduces the cast through their photos and I specifically used the same image and design for the names as the Zoom call because the aesthetic
of the pictures matching the film is quite nice. The pictures themselves have an interactive quality, as they fade when you scroll over them and when clicked upon,
one can read the details about the cast members. Lastly, the last section is titled sponsors and features the three sponsors of the film with their websites linked
to the images incase a user wants to learn more about the organizations involved. 

Reflection/Evaluation: I found this task quite difficult as my undertstanding coding is extremely new and previous experience was very limited. I needed to rewatch
lessons, read things online and ask my friends to figure out the Javascript and CSS a lot of the times because the positions especially confused me a lot. It is 
specifically the syntax difference in each of them that increases my confusion. Because of how complicated it was looking to me, I ended up only following parts
of my initial wireframe and I think thats fine because I had to adapt to my skills. I still went for the minimalistic design I wanted with clear communication and
a good color palette that really tell the story of the film and also how I generally express my design work. I recognize that this work will not be perfect;however, 
I do think the overall user experience could be further enhanced and the concept behind why the website exists could be made clearer.
